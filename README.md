# IBM Data Science Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. These projects cover various stages of the data science process, from data exploration to machine learning modeling, showcasing a comprehensive set of skills acquired throughout the course.

## Overview

Throughout these projects, I applied end-to-end data science workflows, including:

- **Data Mapping**: Understanding and organizing data structures to prepare for analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizing databases and data management tools to efficiently store and access data.
- **Data Visualization**: Communicating insights and findings through visualizations created with popular libraries.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Applying various machine learning algorithms to create predictive models.

Each project allowed me to work with tools and technologies widely used in the data science field, including **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **SQL**.

## Projects

This repository includes the following projects:

1. **Data Wrangling and Analysis**: Exploring and cleaning real-world data, followed by detailed analysis to extract key insights.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing in-depth exploratory analysis to understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating impactful visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
4. **Machine Learning Basics**: Implementing simple machine learning models such as linear regression and decision trees.
5. **Classification and Prediction Models**: Developing classification models for various use cases using algorithms like logistic regression and random forests.
6. **Capstone Project**: Combining all acquired skills to solve a real-world problem through data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data science tasks.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **SQL**: Data retrieval and database management.
